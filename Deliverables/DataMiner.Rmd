### Preface
This document is prepared by Data Miners Team for the purpose of providing background information of the data set. This document also includes the code which was executed to clean the data set.

### Target Audience
The potential users of this particular data set can be:
* Doctors
* Medicine Companies
* Health Researchers’ Groups

### Introduction
This data represented the percentage of expected death, observed deaths and potential death in different states in the United States. All data is collected based on five leading causes of death in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. Heart disease, Cancer, Unintentional injury, Chronic lower respiratory disease and Stroke are the major causes of death that patients are spending so much money for any treatment for them. The data consists of 20,5921 rows and 13 columns.

With analyzing this data and finding differences between Expected Deaths and Observed Deaths, health care can improve public health programs that support healthier behaviors to better access the health care services for the purpose of reducing the rate of potentially excess deaths.

### Draft Research Questions
1. What is the ratio between the observed deaths and expected deaths?
2. The states in which the observed deaths are more in number than the expected deaths?
3. In which area are most deaths observed (metropolitan or non-metropolitan)?
4. In which age group are the most deaths observed?
5. Which is the leading cause for death in each age group?
6. In which year are the most deaths observed?
7. In which benchmark are more deaths observed?
Note: “2010 Fixed” is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2010.
“2015 Fixed” is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2015.
8. What are the top 5 states with more observed deaths in each category?
9. What is the ratio between the observed deaths and the Population?
10. What is the ratio between the expected deaths and the Population?

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
