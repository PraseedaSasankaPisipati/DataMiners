As the team size is very less, all the members participated in all the deliverables equally. Zahra and Praseeda were good at coding and 
handled most of the coding part of the assignments. Sowjanya is good at documentation, so she made sure that all the documents contained 
the information which is requested by the professor. The above contributor table was modified in such a way that, the persons who 
contributed more to that part of the assignment, be it handling the final review or consolidation of work or working on addressing the 
comments given by the professor in the previous assignments.
