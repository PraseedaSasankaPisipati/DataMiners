### This is an informal markdown document for the team project in the "Data to Decisions" Course.
This Document includes:
1. Introduction to the Data Set
2. Draft Research Questions
3. Work Plan
4. Projected Effort Allocation
5. Target Audience

## 1. Introduction to the Data Set
This data represented the percentage of expected death, observed deaths and potential death in different states in the United States. All data collected based on five leading causes of death in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. Heart disease, Cancer, Unintentional injury, Chronic lower respiratory disease and Stroke are the major causes of death that patients are spending so much money for any treatment for them. With analyzing this data and finding differences between Expected Deaths and Observed Deaths,  health care can improve public health programs that support healthier behaviors to better access the health care services for the purpose of reducing the rate of potentially excess deaths.

## 2. Draft Research Questions
1. What is the ratio between the observed deaths and expected deaths?
2. The states in which the observed deaths are more in number than the expected deaths?
3. In which area are most deaths observed (metropolitan or non-metropolitan)?
4. In which age group are the most deaths observed?
5. Which is the leading cause for death in each age group?
6. In which year are the most deaths observed?
7. In which benchmark are more deaths observed?
> Note: “2010 Fixed” is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2010.  
>       “2015 Fixed” is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2015.
8. What are the top 5 states with more observed deaths in each category?
9. What is the ratio between the observed deaths and the Population?
10. What is the ratio between the expected deaths and the Population?

## 3. Work Plan
Below is the Work Plan which reflects the deadlines provided for the deliverables in the Syllabus of the Course. A detailed description of the Plan can be seen in [Gantt Chart](https://github.com/PraseedaSasankaPisipati/DataMiners/blob/master/Deliverables/DataMiners_Project_Plan_GanttChart.pdf)
